## Overview

Civitas is an open-source artificial intelligence framework designed to assist in governance, policy simulation, and optimization of public services.  
Beyond traditional governance tools, Civitas envisions building a comprehensive **virtual yet real society** — a dynamic digital ecosystem that mirrors and interacts with all dimensions of citizens’ lives, including social, economic, cultural, and administrative aspects.

This ambitious vision aims to:  
- Integrate diverse data sources to create a living digital community  
- Enable real-time simulation and management of social dynamics  
- Foster participatory governance by connecting citizens and decision-makers digitally  
- Support seamless interaction between virtual policies and real-world outcomes  

Starting with small, safe prototypes focused on specific tasks like citizen request classification and prioritization, Civitas is designed to expand modularly and organically, ultimately aiming to become a foundational platform for this virtual-real societal ecosystem.  

The project prioritizes:  
- Transparency and explainability  
- Ethical AI practices  
- Human-in-the-loop decision making  
- Robust logging and version control of data and models
