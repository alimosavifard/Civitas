# Project Roadmap for Civitas

This document outlines the proposed development model and roadmap for Civitas.  
It serves as a living guide for contributors and maintainers to understand the planned direction and key milestones of the project.

## Vision

Civitas aims to build a modular, scalable AI framework to support governance and public service optimization, evolving towards a comprehensive virtual-real society platform.

---

## Development Model

- **Modular Architecture:** All components (data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, API, UI, governance) are developed as independent modules with clear interfaces.  
- **Incremental Development:** Start from minimal viable prototypes and iteratively improve with community feedback.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Ensure human oversight in critical decision-making workflows.  
- **Open Collaboration:** Encourage contributions through pull requests, issues, and design discussions.  
- **Code Quality:** Maintain high standards with tests, documentation, and code reviews.
